Welcome to the Protolink documentation.

This site provides an overview of the framework, its concepts, and how to use it in your projects.

## Overview

Protolink is a lightweight, production‑ready framework for **agent‑to‑agent communication**, built around and extending Google’s A2A protocol.

Key ideas:

- **Unified Agent model**: a single `Agent` instance handles both client and server responsibilities.
- **Flexible transports**: HTTP, WebSocket, in‑process runtime, and planned JSON‑RPC / gRPC transports.
- **LLM‑ready architecture**: first‑class integration with API, local, and server‑hosted LLMs.
- **Tools as modules**: native Python tools and MCP tools plugged directly into agents.

Use this documentation to:

- Install Protolink and run your first agent.
- Understand how agents, transports, LLMs, and tools fit together.
- Explore practical examples you can adapt to your own systems.
